-Set each tile's property from TileSet, with override function for special behavior
-Write tile init class





BIG TODO:
Brainstorm procedural enemies and characters

TODO:
Implement Finite state machine for entities (change bools to enums)
Object pooling for projectiles and particles
Write collisionBox mirroring function



Ground sensor points for cliff detection

Fix the camera
Angled curve tile collisions
Acceleration




Implement 4 modes: ground, right wall, left wall ceiling



Implement 6 direction states : pointing left, pointing right
							ground, wall, ceiling
							air, water
							wall state is activated by angle exceeding a certain value
							wind can cause player to be moving left while pointing right at the same time.
							

							


Curved tile collision detection
Collisions with level boundaries



LongTermWishlist:
TileType should store mirrored tile sprites if those sprites are ever used!

Game state switching
Simple Menus
Inventory system
Overworld ala legend of zelda
Procedural sprites

Once these are complete, commit the code

6 worlds 8 levels each with 2 hidden levels per world = 60 levels
4 enemies per world = 24 enemies

Concept:
Player traverses the level with projectile weapons. Halfway through the level, you collect an egg.
This egg protects you from damage, but on one hit, the egg will run away. If you fail to retrieve the egg in 20 seconds
, you die. Your mission is to protect the egg and get it to the end of the level.
You can drop the egg to use your weapons, but it can still get hit, so hide it well!
The egg gives you special powers and will hatch into a flying dragon at the end of the game

TODO:
-Fix movement controls
-Accelerate draw operations http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19429959/cant-accelerate-pixel-modified-bufferedimages



Wishlist:


Change the camera boundaries to collide 32 pixels from the boundary of the level
Handle level boundary collisions

	

Ground speed calculations for momentum conserving movement!
